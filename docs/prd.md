# SPX 0DTE Iron Condor Trading Bot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create multi-strategy trading bot platform with unified dashboard (not TWS replication)
- Phase 1: Automate daily 0DTE Iron Condor trading on SPX with 9:32 ET execution
- Phase 2: Add weekly 42 DTE SPY Strangle with rolling capability
- Implement robust exit management with configurable profit targets and time-based closes
- Enforce comprehensive risk controls including 300% stop-loss and kill-switch capability
- Enable parallel strategy testing through Experiment Mode without capital risk
- Provide strategy-centric monitoring showing status, P/L, and dual time remaining (contract expiry vs strategy exit)
- Track performance metrics per strategy with detailed logs and future parameter tuning
- Ensure system resilience with automatic state recovery and collision prevention
- Enable "set-and-forget" operation suitable for vacation periods
- Create extensible architecture for additional strategies (Flyogonal, etc.)

### Background Context
This project automates a proven options trading strategy that has demonstrated an 83.7% win rate over 300+ backtested trades. The current manual process requires daily attention at specific times, making it incompatible with travel or other commitments. By automating the strategy through Interactive Brokers' TWS API (via IB Gateway), we eliminate human error, ensure consistent execution, and free the trader from daily operational tasks while maintaining the strategy's edge. The system is designed with safety-first principles, ensuring that automation enhances rather than endangers the proven strategy's performance. Critical constraints include single trade per day limits, US market hours operation only, and strict adherence to the proven strategy without autonomous optimization.

**Strategy Validation & Correlation Considerations:** Both SPX Iron Condor (Phase 1) and SPY Strangle (Phase 2) strategies have been extensively backtested over 3+ year periods, demonstrating consistent performance across various market conditions. While SPX and SPY correlation during stress events is acknowledged, the proven historical performance and individual strategy risk controls (300% stop-losses, time-based exits) provide adequate risk management for the current implementation. Portfolio-level correlation analysis and VIX-based regime detection are designated for future enhancement phases but are not required for initial deployment given the robust individual strategy performance and comprehensive risk controls already in place.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** Execute Iron Condor trades daily at 9:32 ET (2 minutes after market open) on SPX 0DTE options
- **FR2:** Select short strikes targeting Delta 15 (±1.9 tolerance, preferring higher delta when equidistant)
- **FR3:** Place long strikes exactly 20 points away from selected short strikes
- **FR4:** Submit Iron Condor as single combo/BAG order to ensure atomic execution
- **FR5:** Create three-order OCA group for exits: 25% profit target (LMT), 11:30 ET close (MKT), 300% stop-loss (STP). **CRITICAL**: Discord CRITICAL alert on FIRST exit order failure (not after retries). On technical failure: automatic retry with configurable attempts (default: 30 attempts over 10 minutes). If all retries fail: Position enters UNPROTECTED state (no exit orders active), [🔴 CLOSE NOW] button appears, emergency market close required. Discord alerts sent immediately on first error and continuously during retry period with current P/L and [CLOSE NOW] option
- **FR6:** Support two trading modes: "Live" (real orders to TWS) and "Experiment" (hypothetical tracking only)
- **FR7:** Maintain persistent state to recover from crashes and prevent duplicate trades
- **FR8:** Send notifications via Discord for trade execution, errors, and critical events
- **FR9:** Provide web dashboard showing real-time status, P/L, and trade history
- **FR10:** Track and store all trade data including entry/exit prices, times, and reasons. Include user-editable notes field per trade for personal insights and commentary. Archive instances: manually via [🗃️ ARCHIVE] button OR automatically after configurable days (default: 30 days). Active/running trades cannot be archived
- **FR11:** Implement kill-switch accessible via Discord and web interface with confirmation dialog
- **FR12:** Respect US market calendar, skipping weekends and market holidays
- **FR13:** Order execution with retry mechanism: Submit order as LMT at current mid-price, cancel and retry with updated mid-price at configurable intervals (default: every 5 seconds) until configurable timeout (default: 1 minute total). After timeout or max retries, mark instance as failed - enable manual archiving via [🗃️ ARCHIVE] button. **Column 1 [🗃️ SKIP] button**: Available for READY/WAIT/WARNING status with mandatory safety confirmation dialog. **Column 2 buttons**: [🔴 STOP] during active work (with confirmation), [🗃️ ARCHIVE] after max retries (no confirmation). Stopped/skipped instances archive with ⏸️ status and $ -, failed instances with ❌ status and $ -
- **FR14:** Calculate position size based on configurable rules (fixed contracts or % of capital/margin)
- **FR15:** Export trade history in CSV format for external analysis
- **FR16:** Execute SPY Strangle trades weekly at configurable time (default Friday 18:00 CET / 12:00 ET, adjusted to 17:00 CET / 11:00 ET on half trading days) using 42 DTE options. Skip entry if mandatory 21 DTE close date falls on non-trading day or after December 31st to prevent year-end tax complications. Display skip reason transparently in UI (Phase 2)
- **FR17:** Calculate strikes using TastyTrade Expected Move formula: 85% of ATM straddle value. Short Put = nearest strike below (Current Price - Expected Move), Short Call = nearest strike above (Current Price + Expected Move). Submit Strangle as single combo/BAG order to ensure atomic execution (Phase 2)
- **FR18:** Implement defensive rolling: when strike tested (ATM/ITM) at ≤28 DTE, roll untested side to target Delta 30 (±1.9 tolerance, preferring higher absolute delta when equidistant). Maximum one roll per position (First-Touch-Rule). Check performed daily at original trade setup time. Send standard notification when any leg becomes ATM/ITM at ≤28 DTE. Send escalated/prominent notification for any subsequent touches after First-Touch-Rule has been applied (Phase 2)
- **FR19:** Enforce mandatory close at 21 DTE for SPY Strangle regardless of P/L or roll status, executed at entry time (18:00 CET / 12:00 ET on normal trading days, 2 hours before market close on half trading days) (Phase 2)
- **FR20:** Display dual time remaining: options expiry time (DTE) AND strategy exit time (TTC - Time to Close) for all positions. Time format: days with decimals (e.g., "2.5d") for consistency across all views
- **FR21:** Provide streamlined installation and setup process via Homebrew with private tap distribution, web-based configuration wizard, and automatic browser launch for initial setup
- **FR22:** Instance ID format: [STRATEGY_ABBREV]-[YYMMDD]-[###] where STRATEGY_ABBREV is max 6 characters (e.g., SPXIC-240115-001). Each strategy must define its unique abbreviation
- **FR23:** Order retry configuration: user-configurable retry parameters per strategy in settings. **Entry orders**: Default 5-second intervals for 1 minute total (12 attempts). **Exit orders**: Default 30 attempts every 20 seconds (10 minutes total) before automatic emergency close. All retry mechanisms use updated mid-price on each attempt
- **FR24:** TWS state reconciliation: Poll TWS every 10 seconds during retry operations to detect manual interventions (position closed, OCA manually set). Adapt system state accordingly and notify via Discord

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** System must maintain connection to IB Gateway with automatic reconnection on disconnect
- **NFR2:** All sensitive credentials must be encrypted and stored in environment variables
- **NFR3:** System must run continuously in containerized environment (Podman) on Mac Mini server
- **NFR4:** Response time for dashboard updates must be under 2 seconds
- **NFR5:** System must log all actions with timestamps for audit trail
- **NFR6:** Database must handle minimum 5 years of trade history without performance degradation

- **NFR10:** Web interface must be mobile-responsive for iPhone access
- **NFR11:** Display times in user-configurable timezone (default CET) with market time (ET) always shown in parentheses. All time displays must show both user timezone and market timezone simultaneously (e.g., "18:00 CET (12:00 ET)"). 
  - **Column 1 NEXT instances**: First content line shows execution time with prefix based on temporal distance: "Today" (same day), "Tom" (tomorrow), weekday abbreviation (2-6 days), full locale date format (>6 days). Second content line in ✅ Ready and ⏸️ Wait status shows remaining time until execution: "in 2h 15m" (same day) or "in 5 days" (future days). At execution time, instances automatically progress from NEXT (Column 1) to SEARCH OPTIONS (Column 2).
  - **Column 2 SEARCH OPTIONS instances**: Status types: 🔄 DOING (actively searching OR retry in progress), ❌ ERROR (search failed, waiting for retry OR max retries reached). For 🔄 DOING: Line 3 shows progress ("Finding delta 15...", "Retrying search..."), Line 4 shows details ("Scanning strikes...", "Attempt 3/10"). For ❌ ERROR: Line 3 shows error message ("No market data", "No TWS connection", "No options found", "Search timeout", "Search failed"), Line 4 shows retry counter ("Retry 5/10" or "Retry 10/10 (MAX)"). Error-Retry cycle: ❌ ERROR → waits 20 seconds (globally configurable per error type) → 🔄 DOING → retry → success/failure. **Button logic**: [🔴 STOP] during active work (with confirmation), [🗃️ ARCHIVE] only at max retries (no confirmation). After successful search, instance automatically progresses to Column 3 (PLACE ORDER). Failed instances move to ARCHIVE with ❌ status after manual archiving or 30-day auto-archive.
  - **Column 3 PLACE ORDER instances**: Status types: 🔄 DOING (placing order OR order modify in progress), ❌ ERROR (order failed, retry in progress OR max retries reached). For 🔄 DOING: Line 3 shows progress ("Placing order..." for initial submit, "Waiting for fill..." after order modifications), Line 4 shows current LMT price ("LMT: $2.50" initial, "LMT: $2.45 (Try 3/X)" after modifications). For ❌ ERROR: Line 3 shows error message, Line 4 shows retry counter ("Retry 5/10") or failure state. **Error types by mode**: LIVE instances can encounter "Order rejected", "Insufficient margin", "Order cancelled" (all lead directly to "Order failed" state), "No TWS connection" (allows 10 retries with 20-second intervals, globally configurable retry count and intervals per error type). EXPERIMENT instances only encounter "No TWS connection" (requires TWS for current mid-price simulation). **Order retry mechanisms**: (1) System Error Retries - 10 attempts with 20-second intervals (globally configurable retry count and intervals per error type) for connection/system failures; (2) Order Modify Retries - configurable per strategy (default: 5-second intervals for 1-minute maximum duration) for unfilled orders at mid-price. **Button logic**: [🔴 STOP] during retries (with confirmation), [🗃️ ARCHIVE] when "Order failed" state reached (no confirmation). **Definition of Done (DoD)**: SUCCESS - automatic progression to Column 4 when order 100% filled and position confirmed in TWS; FAILURE - instances move to ARCHIVE with ❌ status after manual archiving or 30-day auto-archive; MANUAL STOP - direct move to ARCHIVE with ⏸️ status.
  - **Column 4 SETUP ORDER EXIT instances**: **CRITICAL COLUMN** - Any failure = UNPROTECTED position (unlimited risk). Status types: 🔄 DOING (setting OCA group), ❌ ERROR (exit setup failed, retry in progress), 🚨 UNPROTECTED (max retries reached, no exit orders). For 🔄 DOING: Line 3 shows "Setting OCA...", Line 4 shows "Validating group...". For ❌ ERROR: Line 3 shows error ("No TWS connection", "No market data", "Order timeout"), Line 4 shows "Retry X/30". **Discord CRITICAL alert on FIRST error** (not after retries) with [CLOSE NOW] option. Errors: "No TWS connection", "No market data" (both 30 retries @ 20s), "Order timeout" (30 retries @ 20s), "OCA rejected" (programming error, no retry). For 🚨 UNPROTECTED: Line 3 shows "🚨 UNPROTECTED", Line 4 shows "No exit orders!", Button shows [🔴 CLOSE NOW]. After position closed → [🗃️ ARCHIVE] available. **Price Rounding Rule**: All LMT/STP prices rounded to $0.05 increments. **DoD**: SUCCESS - all 3 exit orders accepted, automatic progression to Column 5; FAILURE - enters UNPROTECTED state requiring emergency market close.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a confidence-inspiring, glanceable monitoring interface that provides immediate status awareness and critical controls without overwhelming detail. The interface should embody "set-and-forget" reliability while offering rich data for those who want to dive deeper.

### Design Philosophy
- **Clarity Over Features:** In critical moments, users need instant understanding, not complex features
- **Consistent Hierarchy:** Strict separation between system-level, strategy-level, and trade-level information
- **Safety First:** Dangerous actions are visually distinct and require confirmation
- **Mobile Ready:** All critical functions accessible on mobile devices

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Status-First Display:** Clear status indicators (active/waiting) with mode badges (💰 Live / 🧪 Experiment)
- **Per-Strategy Mode Control:** Each strategy has independent Live/Experiment mode switching
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Summary view with drill-down to detailed trade information
- **Action Confirmation:** Mode switches and emergency stop require simple confirmation dialogs
- **Real-Time Updates:** Live data refresh without page reloads using HTMX
- **Mobile-First Controls:** Large touch targets (44px minimum) for critical actions on mobile devices

  - Archive settings (auto-archive days, manual archive options)
- **Trade History/Archive:** Historical instances with filtering and export capabilities
- **Discord Interface:** Text-based status queries and remote emergency stop activation

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The interface will meet WCAG AA standards with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility for essential functions.

### Branding
Slick, modern design inspired by Apple's Aqua interface style with glossy buttons, smooth gradients, and refined shadows. Professional financial interface aesthetic with subtle color coding for profit (green) and loss (red), implemented with the polished look of macOS native applications. Emphasis on both data clarity and visual elegance with translucent elements and depth. Dark mode support for extended monitoring sessions while maintaining the Aqua-style polish.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary: Desktop web browsers for detailed monitoring
Secondary: Mobile web (iPhone) for status checks and emergency controls
Auxiliary: Discord bot for notifications and remote command execution

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all components (bot, web dashboard, Discord bot) for simplified deployment and version management.

### Service Architecture
**Modular Monolith within Container:** Single Python application with distinct modules for trading logic, web server, and Discord bot, all running in one Podman container. This provides simplicity for initial deployment while maintaining clean separation of concerns for future scaling.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Unit tests for critical trading logic (delta matching, order creation), integration tests for IB Gateway communication, and manual testing convenience methods for verifying trades in experiment mode before going live.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Language:** Python 3.11+ for all components
- **IB API Library:** ib_insync for TWS communication (TWS preferred over IB Gateway for auto-login)
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI for REST API and web dashboard backend
- **Frontend:** HTML + HTMX + Chart.js (no build pipeline required)
- **Discord Library:** discord.py for bot implementation
- **Database:** SQLite for trade history and state management (migration path to PostgreSQL if needed)
- **Container:** Podman for deployment on Mac Mini server
- **TWS:** Preferred over IB Gateway for automatic session restoration after restart
- **Market Data:** OPRA subscription required for real-time options Greeks
- **Deployment:** Mac Mini server with persistent storage volumes
- **Monitoring:** Built-in health checks and status endpoints
- **Configuration (Hybrid Approach):** 
  - YAML files for non-sensitive trading parameters (deltas, timing, position sizing)
  - Encrypted SQLite table for secrets (Discord token, IB credentials, API keys)
  - Master encryption key stored in macOS Keychain
  - Python cryptography library (Fernet) for symmetric encryption

### Order Execution Framework Note for Architect
All strategies use unified order execution pattern: mid-price calculation from IB quotes, LMT order submission, and configurable retry logic with updated pricing on each attempt. Implement generic order execution engine with per-strategy configuration parameters: retry intervals (default: 5 seconds), timeout duration (default: 1 minute), and max attempts (default: 12). Strategy-specific execution windows (SPX IC: critical 9:32-9:33 ET timing, SPY Strangle: relaxed Friday evening timing) handled through different timeout configurations. All strategies use combo/BAG orders for atomic execution. This unified approach reduces code duplication while maintaining strategy-specific flexibility.

### Operational Edge Case Handling Requirements for Architect
The system must handle critical operational failures gracefully to prevent capital loss and ensure reliable automated trading. Key requirements:

**System Recovery & State Management:**
- Implement position reconciliation on startup by comparing database state with TWS actual positions
- Handle bot crash scenarios during critical windows (e.g., 9:31-9:35 ET for SPX strategy) with missed window detection and trader alerts
- Ensure database transaction consistency during order execution - treat entry order + exit orders as atomic unit
- Implement graceful degradation during network outages with position status caching and recovery procedures

**Market Disruption Handling:**
- Handle trading halts on underlying securities by queuing exit orders until market reopens
- Manage circuit breaker scenarios with extended exit windows when markets are paused
- Account for early assignment risks on American-style options (SPY) with position status monitoring
- Adapt execution times for half-trading days while maintaining strategy integrity

**Connection & TWS Integration:**
- Implement robust TWS connection management with automatic reconnection and session restoration
- Handle TWS daily restart gracefully during market hours without losing active orders or positions
- Implement API rate limiting and backoff strategies to prevent connection throttling
- Ensure order status verification after connection restore to prevent duplicate or missed orders

**Error Classification & Response:**
- Define clear error severity levels: INFO (recoverable), WARNING (requires attention), CRITICAL (immediate action required), FATAL (system halt required)
- Implement escalating notification system with configurable channels (Discord, email, SMS)
- Ensure all fatal errors trigger immediate trader notification with system status and recommended actions
- Log all operational errors with sufficient context for post-incident analysis and system improvement

**Fail-Safe Mechanisms:**
- Default to safe mode on ambiguous system state - prefer no action over potentially harmful action
- Implement emergency position closure mechanisms when system integrity is compromised
- Ensure kill-switch functionality remains accessible even during system degradation
- Maintain audit trail of all system decisions and error responses for regulatory and debugging purposes

**I want** to submit the Iron Condor and immediately place protective exit orders,
**So that** I'm never exposed to unlimited risk.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Create combo/BAG order with all 4 legs correctly
2. Calculate mid-price from IB's combo quote
3. Submit order as LMT at mid-price with configurable retry logic (default: every 5 seconds for 1 minute total)
   - All LMT and STP prices must be rounded to $0.05 increments (e.g., $2.347 → $2.35, $2.324 → $2.30)
4. Upon fill confirmation, IMMEDIATELY place OCA group with three exit orders:
   - 25% profit target (LMT order - rounded to $0.05)
