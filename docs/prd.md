# SPX 0DTE Iron Condor Trading Bot Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create multi-strategy trading bot platform with unified dashboard (not TWS replication)
- Phase 1: Automate daily 0DTE Iron Condor trading on SPX with 9:32 ET execution
- Phase 2: Add weekly 42 DTE SPY Strangle with rolling capability
- Implement robust exit management with configurable profit targets and time-based closes
- Enforce comprehensive risk controls including 300% stop-loss and kill-switch capability
- Enable parallel strategy testing through Experiment Mode without capital risk
- Provide strategy-centric monitoring showing status, P/L, and dual time remaining (contract expiry vs strategy exit)
- Track performance metrics per strategy with detailed logs and future parameter tuning
- Ensure system resilience with automatic state recovery and collision prevention
- Enable "set-and-forget" operation suitable for vacation periods
- Create extensible architecture for additional strategies (Flyogonal, etc.)

### Background Context
The idea for this project was to automate a proven options trading strategy that has demonstrated an 83.7% win rate over 300+ backtested trades: the "Daily 0DTE SPX Iron Condor". The current manual process requires daily attention at specific times, making it incompatible with travel or other commitments. By automating the strategy through Interactive Brokers' TWS API (via TWS or IB Gateway), we eliminate human error, ensure consistent execution, and free the trader from daily operational tasks while maintaining the strategy's edge. The system is designed with safety-first principles, ensuring that automation enhances rather than endangers the proven strategy's performance. Critical constraints include single trade per day limits, US market hours operation only, strict adherence to the proven strategy without autonomous optimization, and not overriding but intelligently accepting manual changes made in TWS by the user while a strategy order is currently running.

**Strategy Validation & Correlation Considerations:** Both SPX Iron Condor (Phase 1) and SPY Strangle (Phase 2) strategies have been extensively backtested over 3+ year periods, demonstrating consistent performance across various market conditions. While SPX and SPY correlation during stress events is acknowledged, the proven historical performance and individual strategy risk controls (300% stop-losses, time-based exits) provide adequate risk management for the current implementation. Portfolio-level correlation analysis and VIX-based regime detection are designated for future enhancement phases but are not required for initial deployment given the robust individual strategy performance and comprehensive risk controls already in place.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** Execute Iron Condor trades daily at 9:32 ET (2 minutes after market open) on SPX 0DTE options
- **FR2:** Select short strikes targeting Delta 15 (±1.9 tolerance, preferring higher delta when equidistant)
- **FR3:** Place long strikes exactly 20 points away from selected short strikes
- **FR4:** Submit Iron Condor as single combo/BAG order to ensure atomic execution
- **FR5:** Create three-order OCA group for exits: 25% profit target (LMT), 11:30 ET close (MKT), 300% stop-loss (STP). **CRITICAL**: Discord CRITICAL alert on FIRST exit order failure (not after retries). On technical failure: automatic retry with configurable attempts (default: 30 attempts over 10 minutes). If all retries fail: Position enters UNPROTECTED state (no exit orders active), emergency market close required. Discord alerts sent immediately on first error and continuously during retry period with current P/L and emergency close option
- **FR6:** Support two trading modes: "Live" (real orders to TWS) and "Experiment" (hypothetical tracking only)
- **FR7:** Maintain persistent state to recover from crashes and prevent duplicate trades
- **FR8:** Send notifications via Discord for trade execution, errors, and critical events
- **FR9:** Provide web dashboard showing real-time status, P/L, and trade history
- **FR10:** Track and store all trade data including entry/exit prices, times, and reasons. Include user-editable notes field per trade for personal insights and commentary. Archive instances: Closed instances can be manually archived OR automatically after configurable days (default: 30 days). Active/running trades cannot be archived. After emergency market close, instances move to closed state and follow standard archiving rules
- **FR11:** Implement kill-switch accessible via Discord and web interface with confirmation dialog
- **FR12:** Respect US market calendar, skipping weekends and market holidays
- **FR13:** Order execution with retry mechanism: Submit order as LMT at current mid-price, cancel and retry with updated mid-price at configurable intervals (default: every 5 seconds) until configurable timeout (default: 1 minute total). After timeout or max retries, mark instance as failed - enable manual archiving. **Skip function**: Available for scheduled instances with mandatory safety confirmation. **Stop function**: Available during active operations with confirmation. Stopped/skipped instances archive with SKIPPED status and null P/L, failed instances with ERROR status and null P/L
- **FR14:** Calculate position size based on configurable rules (fixed contracts or % of capital/margin)
- **FR15:** Export trade history in CSV format for external analysis
- **FR16:** Execute SPY Strangle trades weekly at configurable time (default Friday 18:00 CET / 12:00 ET, adjusted to 17:00 CET / 11:00 ET on half trading days) using 42 DTE options. Skip entry if mandatory 21 DTE close date falls on non-trading day or after December 31st to prevent year-end tax complications. Display skip reason transparently in UI (Phase 2)
- **FR17:** Calculate strikes using TastyTrade Expected Move formula: 85% of ATM straddle value. Short Put = nearest strike below (Current Price - Expected Move), Short Call = nearest strike above (Current Price + Expected Move). Submit Strangle as single combo/BAG order to ensure atomic execution (Phase 2)
- **FR18:** Implement defensive rolling: when strike tested (ATM/ITM) at ≤28 DTE, roll untested side to target Delta 30 (±1.9 tolerance, preferring higher absolute delta when equidistant). Maximum one roll per position (First-Touch-Rule). Check performed daily at original trade setup time. Send standard notification when any leg becomes ATM/ITM at ≤28 DTE. Send escalated/prominent notification for any subsequent touches after First-Touch-Rule has been applied (Phase 2)
- **FR19:** Enforce mandatory close at 21 DTE for SPY Strangle regardless of P/L or roll status, executed at entry time (18:00 CET / 12:00 ET on normal trading days, 2 hours before market close on half trading days) (Phase 2)
- **FR20:** Display dual time remaining: options expiry time (DTE) AND strategy exit time (TTC - Time to Close) for all positions. Time format: days with decimals (e.g., "2.5d") for consistency across all views
- **FR21:** Provide streamlined installation and setup process via Homebrew with private tap distribution, web-based configuration wizard, and automatic browser launch for initial setup
- **FR22:** Instance ID format: [STRATEGY_ABBREV]-[YYMMDD]-[###] where STRATEGY_ABBREV is max 6 characters (e.g., SPXIC-240115-001). Each strategy must define its unique abbreviation
- **FR23:** Order retry configuration: user-configurable retry parameters per strategy in settings. **Entry orders**: Default 5-second intervals for 1 minute total (12 attempts). **Exit orders**: Default 30 attempts every 20 seconds (10 minutes total) before automatic emergency close. All retry mechanisms use updated mid-price on each attempt
- **FR24:** TWS state reconciliation: Poll TWS every 10 seconds during retry operations to detect manual interventions (position closed, OCA manually set). Adapt system state accordingly and notify via Discord
- **FR25:** Orphaned order detection: After position closure, scan TWS for any open orders matching the closed trade's strike prices and expiration dates. This includes both OCA group orders and standalone orders that may have been manually created. Alert via Discord CRITICAL when orphaned orders are detected, requiring manual cleanup in TWS before archiving

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** System must maintain connection to IB Gateway with automatic reconnection on disconnect
- **NFR2:** All sensitive credentials must be encrypted and stored in environment variables
- **NFR3:** System must run continuously in containerized environment (Podman) on Mac Mini server
- **NFR4:** Response time for dashboard updates must be under 2 seconds
- **NFR5:** System must log all actions with timestamps for audit trail
- **NFR6:** Database must handle minimum 5 years of trade history without performance degradation
- **NFR7:** System must send critical alerts within 10 seconds of event occurrence
- **NFR8:** Architecture must support addition of new strategies without modifying core engine
- **NFR9:** System must handle IB Gateway daily restart gracefully at any configured time
- **NFR10:** Web interface must be mobile-responsive for iPhone access
- **NFR11:** Display times in user-configurable timezone (default CET) with market time (ET) always shown in parentheses. All time displays must show both user timezone and market timezone simultaneously (e.g., "18:00 CET (12:00 ET)").

## Meta-Strategy Model

### Overview
The Meta-Strategy Model provides an abstract framework for defining options trading strategies in a consistent, extensible manner. This model enables the UI/UX to remain strategy-agnostic while supporting diverse trading approaches. Future strategies can be added through configuration without modifying core system architecture.

### Extensibility Patterns

#### Required Components
Every strategy MUST define:
- Identity (id, name, abbreviation, underlying)
- Schedule (trigger, frequency, executionTime)
- Entry (at least one leg with strike selection)
- Exit (at least one exit condition)

#### Optional Components
Strategies MAY include:
- Position adjustments (rolling, hedging)
- Multiple exit conditions
- Custom alerts and notifications
- Strategy-specific parameters

#### Validation Rules
1. Strategy ID must be unique across system
2. Abbreviation must be ≤6 characters
3. At least one exit condition required
4. DTE target must be ≥0
5. All monetary values rounded to $0.05

#### Future: Configuration File Format
Strategies will be definable via YAML/JSON configuration files, enabling:
- Hot-loading of new strategies without code changes
- Version control of strategy parameters
- A/B testing of strategy variations
- User-defined custom strategies

### Instance Lifecycle Mapping

Every strategy instance follows the same lifecycle through the Kanban columns:

```
SCHEDULED → SEARCHING → ORDERING → PROTECTING → ACTIVE → CLOSED → ARCHIVED
```

Instance ID format: `[abbreviation]-[YYMMDD]-[###]`
- SPXIC-240115-001 (Strategy A instance)
- SPYST-240115-001 (Strategy B instance)

## Trading State Model

### Overview
The Trading State Model defines the abstract states and transitions for all trading instances, independent of UI implementation. Each state represents a distinct phase in the trading lifecycle with specific business logic and requirements.

### Core States

#### SCHEDULED
- **Purpose**: Instance is scheduled for future execution
- **Sub-states**: READY (market open), WAIT (market closed), WARNING (configuration issues)
- **Entry**: Created when strategy schedule triggers
- **Exit**: Automatically transitions to SEARCHING at scheduled execution time
- **Actions**: Can be skipped manually with confirmation

#### SEARCHING
- **Purpose**: Finding appropriate option contracts
- **Sub-states**: DOING (active search), ERROR (search failed)
- **Entry**: From SCHEDULED at execution time
- **Exit**: To ORDERING when options found, or ARCHIVED if failed/stopped
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retries (default: 10 attempts at 30-second intervals)
- **Actions**: Can be stopped manually during execution

#### ORDERING
- **Purpose**: Placing and filling the order
- **Sub-states**: DOING (order active), ERROR (order failed)
- **Entry**: From SEARCHING with valid options
- **Exit**: To PROTECTING when filled, or ARCHIVED if failed/stopped
- **Retry Logic**: 
  - System errors: 10 attempts at 20-second intervals
  - Order modifications: Per-strategy configuration (default: 5-second intervals for 1 minute)
- **Actions**: Can be stopped manually during execution

#### PROTECTING
- **Purpose**: Setting up exit orders (OCA group)
- **Sub-states**: DOING (setting exits), ERROR (setup failed), UNPROTECTED (no protection)
- **Entry**: From ORDERING with filled position
- **Exit**: To ACTIVE when protected, or emergency close if UNPROTECTED
- **Critical**: FIRST failure triggers immediate Discord alert
- **Retry Logic**: 30 attempts at 20-second intervals before UNPROTECTED state
- **Actions**: Emergency market close always available

#### ACTIVE
- **Purpose**: Position is live and being monitored
- **Sub-states**: RUNNING (normal), WARNING (threshold breach), ROLLING (adjustment), ERROR (critical issue)
- **Entry**: From PROTECTING with exit orders confirmed
- **Exit**: To CLOSED when exit triggers
- **Monitoring**: Real-time P/L, Greeks, time remaining
- **Actions**: Emergency market close based on market hours

#### CLOSED
- **Purpose**: Position has been closed and finalized
- **Sub-states**: 
  - DONE (successful exit via any defined exit condition)
  - ERROR (orphaned orders detected, reconciliation issues)
- **Entry**: From ACTIVE via exit trigger or manual close
- **Exit**: To ARCHIVED manually or after configured period (default: 30 days)
- **Data**: 
  - Final P/L from TWS
  - Exit reason from strategy configuration
  - Close timestamp
  - Order cleanup status
- **Validation**: Post-close orphaned order detection
- **Actions**: Manual archive, orphaned order cleanup

#### ARCHIVED
- **Purpose**: Historical record preservation
- **Sub-states**: DONE (completed), ERROR (failed), SKIPPED (never executed)
- **Entry**: From CLOSED or directly from any state via skip/stop
- **Exit**: None (terminal state)
- **Data**: Complete trade history
- **Actions**: None (read-only)

### State Transition Rules

#### Normal Flow
1. SCHEDULED → SEARCHING (automatic at execution time)
2. SEARCHING → ORDERING (options found)
3. ORDERING → PROTECTING (order filled)
4. PROTECTING → ACTIVE (exits confirmed)
5. ACTIVE → CLOSED (exit triggered)
6. CLOSED → ARCHIVED (manual or automatic)

#### Error/Skip Flows
- Any state → ARCHIVED (via manual skip/stop)
- ERROR at max retries → ARCHIVED (manual archive required)
- UNPROTECTED → emergency close → CLOSED → ARCHIVED

### Business Rules by State

#### Retry Behavior
- System must track retry attempts per error type
- Configurable retry intervals and max attempts per state
- Alternating status during retry cycles (ERROR ↔ DOING)
- Automatic progression to terminal state at max retries

#### Critical Alerts
- PROTECTING state: First error triggers immediate Discord alert
- UNPROTECTED state: Continuous alerts with P/L and emergency close option
- System failures: Alert on connection loss or data feed issues

#### State Persistence
- All state transitions must be logged with timestamp
- Current state must survive system restart
- Historical states preserved for audit trail
- State reconciliation with broker on reconnection

#### Post-Close Validation (CLOSED State)
- Orphaned order detection must run after every position closure
- Scan for orders matching exact strike prices and expiration dates
- Include both system-created and manually-created orders in scan
- Block archiving if orphaned orders detected (require manual cleanup)
- Generate CRITICAL alert with specific order details for cleanup

#### Discord Notification Mapping by State/Column

**Column 1 (SCHEDULED/NEXT):**
- READY status: INFO - "Strategy ready for execution at [time]"
- WARNING status: WARNING - System issues (TWS disconnected, insufficient capital)
- Manual SKIP: INFO - "Instance skipped by user"

#### Time-Based Transitions
- SCHEDULED → SEARCHING: At configured execution time
- ACTIVE time-based exits: At configured time or DTE threshold
- CLOSED → ARCHIVED: After configured retention period

### Configuration Requirements

Each strategy must define:
- Retry parameters per state (attempts, intervals)
- Alert thresholds and notification preferences
- Archive retention period
- Emergency close availability rules

System must provide:
- Global default retry settings
- State transition logging
- Recovery from interrupted states
- Manual state override capabilities (with audit)

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a confidence-inspiring, glanceable monitoring interface that provides immediate status awareness and critical controls without overwhelming detail. The interface should embody "set-and-forget" reliability while offering rich data for those who want to dive deeper.

### Design Philosophy
- **Clarity Over Features:** In critical moments, users need instant understanding, not complex features
- **Consistent Hierarchy:** Strict separation between system-level, strategy-level, and trade-level information
- **Safety First:** Dangerous actions are visually distinct and require confirmation
- **Mobile Ready:** All critical functions accessible on mobile devices

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Status-First Display:** Clear status indicators (active/waiting) with mode badges (💰 Live / 🧪 Experiment)
- **Per-Strategy Mode Control:** Each strategy has independent Live/Experiment mode switching
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Summary view with drill-down to detailed trade information
- **Action Confirmation:** Mode switches and emergency stop require simple confirmation dialogs
- **Real-Time Updates:** Live data refresh without page reloads using HTMX
- **Mobile-First Controls:** Large touch targets (44px minimum) for critical actions on mobile devices

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The interface will meet WCAG AA standards with proper color contrast, keyboard navigation support, and screen reader compatibility for essential functions.

### Branding
Slick, modern design inspired by Apple's Aqua interface style with glossy buttons, smooth gradients, and refined shadows. Professional financial interface aesthetic with subtle color coding for profit (green) and loss (red), implemented with the polished look of macOS native applications. Emphasis on both data clarity and visual elegance with translucent elements and depth. Dark mode support for extended monitoring sessions while maintaining the Aqua-style polish.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary: Desktop web browsers for detailed monitoring
Secondary: Mobile web (iPhone) for status checks and emergency controls
Auxiliary: Discord bot for notifications and remote command execution

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing all components (bot, web dashboard, Discord bot) for simplified deployment and version management.

### Service Architecture
**Modular Monolith within Container:** Single Python application with distinct modules for trading logic, web server, and Discord bot, all running in one Podman container. This provides simplicity for initial deployment while maintaining clean separation of concerns for future scaling.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration Testing:** Unit tests for critical trading logic (delta matching, order creation), integration tests for IB Gateway communication, and manual testing convenience methods for verifying trades in experiment mode before going live.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Language:** Python 3.11+ for all components
- **IB API Library:** ib_async for TWS communication (CRITICAL UPDATE: ib_insync unmaintained since 2024, ib_async v2.0.1 is the actively maintained, production-ready successor)
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI for REST API and web dashboard backend
- **Frontend:** HTML + HTMX + Chart.js with Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI (2025 production pattern: Server-Sent Events for real-time updates, HTML-first approach, professional UI components, no build pipeline required)
- **Discord Library:** discord.py for bot implementation
- **Database:** SQLite for trade history and state management (migration path to PostgreSQL if needed)
- **Container:** Podman for deployment on Mac Mini server
- **TWS:** Preferred over IB Gateway for automatic session restoration after restart
- **Market Data:** OPRA subscription required for real-time options Greeks
- **Deployment:** Mac Mini server with persistent storage volumes
- **Monitoring:** Built-in health checks and status endpoints
- **Configuration (Hybrid Approach):** 
  - YAML files for non-sensitive trading parameters (deltas, timing, position sizing)
  - Encrypted SQLite table for secrets (Discord token, IB credentials, API keys)
  - Master encryption key stored in macOS Keychain
  - Python cryptography library (Fernet) for symmetric encryption

### Order Execution Framework Note for Architect
All strategies use unified order execution pattern: mid-price calculation from IB quotes, LMT order submission, and configurable retry logic with updated pricing on each attempt. Implement generic order execution engine with per-strategy configuration parameters: retry intervals (default: 5 seconds), timeout duration (default: 1 minute), and max attempts (default: 12). Strategy-specific execution windows (SPX IC: critical 9:32-9:33 ET timing, SPY Strangle: relaxed Friday evening timing) handled through different timeout configurations. All strategies use combo/BAG orders for atomic execution with ib_async bracketOrder() helper function and oneCancelsAll() method for OCA group management. **OCA Implementation Details**: Use ib.bracketOrder('BUY', quantity, limitPrice, takeProfitPrice, stopLossPrice) to create three-order structure, then place each order individually. For manual control, use oneCancelsAll([profit_order, stop_order, time_order], ocaGroup="strategy_id", ocaType=1) for custom OCA groups. This unified approach reduces code duplication while maintaining strategy-specific flexibility.

### Operational Edge Case Handling Requirements for Architect
The system must handle critical operational failures gracefully to prevent capital loss and ensure reliable automated trading. Key requirements:

**System Recovery & State Management:**
- Implement position reconciliation on startup by comparing database state with TWS actual positions
- Handle bot crash scenarios during critical windows (e.g., 9:31-9:35 ET for SPX strategy) with missed window detection and trader alerts
- Ensure database transaction consistency during order execution - treat entry order + exit orders as atomic unit
- Implement graceful degradation during network outages with position status caching and recovery procedures

**Market Disruption Handling:**
- Handle trading halts on underlying securities by queuing exit orders until market reopens
- Manage circuit breaker scenarios with extended exit windows when markets are paused
- Account for early assignment risks on American-style options (SPY) with position status monitoring
- Adapt execution times for half-trading days while maintaining strategy integrity

**Connection & TWS Integration:**
- Implement robust TWS connection management with automatic reconnection and session restoration
- Handle TWS daily restart gracefully during market hours without losing active orders or positions
- Implement API rate limiting and backoff strategies to prevent connection throttling
- Ensure order status verification after connection restore to prevent duplicate or missed orders

**Error Classification & Response:**
- Define clear error severity levels: INFO (recoverable), WARNING (requires attention), CRITICAL (immediate action required), FATAL (system halt required)
- Implement escalating notification system with configurable channels (Discord, email, SMS)
- Ensure all fatal errors trigger immediate trader notification with system status and recommended actions
- Log all operational errors with sufficient context for post-incident analysis and system improvement

**Fail-Safe Mechanisms:**
- Default to safe mode on ambiguous system state - prefer no action over potentially harmful action
- Implement emergency position closure mechanisms when system integrity is compromised
- Ensure kill-switch functionality remains accessible even during system degradation
- Maintain audit trail of all system decisions and error responses for regulatory and debugging purposes
