# Advanced Elicitation Topics - Multi-Strategy Trading Bot
## Temporary Storage for Strategic Analysis

---

## Topic 1: Capital & Risk Management ✅ COMPLETED
*Integrated into PRD as Story 1.2*

### Key Decisions Made:
- Two position sizing modes: Fixed Contracts (user-configurable) and Percentage of NLV
- Real-time validation with 3-level warning system (Critical/Danger/Warning)
- Strategy priority: SPX Condor (daily) > SPY Strangle (weekly)
- Minimum capital requirements: $10k for both strategies
- Safety mechanisms: 30% buffer, 70% max margin utilization, 20% max risk

---

## Topic 2: Correlation & Portfolio Effects ✅ COMPLETED
*Addressed in PRD Background Context - strategies have 3+ years backtesting, correlation analysis designated for future phases*

### Key Questions:
**Q2.1:** SPX and SPY are highly correlated. During a market crash, both strategies could hit stop-losses simultaneously. Should there be:
- Portfolio-level maximum loss limit?
- Correlation-aware position sizing?
- Circuit breaker if both strategies lose on same day?

**Q2.2:** Have you considered VIX levels affecting both strategies?
- Should high VIX pause new entries?
- Different parameters during high volatility regimes?

### Analysis Needed:
- Correlation coefficient between SPX and SPY during stress events
- Historical VIX thresholds for regime detection
- Portfolio heat limits during high correlation periods
- Dynamic position sizing based on market regime

## Topic 3: Rolling Complexity Deep Dive ✅ COMPLETED  
*Integrated into PRD FR18 - First-Touch-Rule with Delta 30 targeting, escalated notifications, simplified P&L tracking*

### Key Questions:
**Q3.1:** For the SPY Strangle rolling mechanism - what if BOTH sides get tested in volatile markets?
- Roll both sides?
- Close entire position?
- Freeze and wait for 21 DTE?

**Q3.2:** After rolling the untested side, what if the market reverses and now THAT side gets tested?
- Allow multiple rolls?
- Maximum roll count?
- Roll fee consideration?

### Edge Cases to Define:
- Double-touch scenario (both sides ATM/ITM)
- Whipsaw markets after rolling
- Maximum number of rolls per position
- Cost-benefit analysis of rolling vs closing
- P&L tracking complexity after multiple rolls

---

## Topic 4: Operational Edge Cases ✅ COMPLETED
*Vollständig in PRD integriert - detaillierte Implementierungsanforderungen für System Recovery, Market Disruptions, Connection Management, Error Classification und Fail-Safe Mechanismen definiert*

### Critical Scenarios:
**Q4.1:** Partial fill handling:
- Only 1 leg of strangle fills - what happens?
- SPX Condor partially filled (2 of 4 legs)
- Market becomes illiquid during exit
- Wide bid-ask spreads during time-based exits

**Q4.2:** Market disruptions:
- Trading halts on SPY during exit window
- Circuit breakers triggered during position management
- Early assignment on SPY options (American-style)
- Gap openings after weekends

**Q4.3:** System recovery scenarios:
- Bot crashes at 9:31 ET, restarts at 9:35 (missed SPX window)
- Network down for 2 hours during active position
- TWS daily restart happens during market hours
- Database corruption during trade execution

### Implementation Requirements:
- Partial fill detection and handling
- Market condition monitoring
- Graceful degradation during outages
- State recovery validation
- Emergency position reconciliation

## Topic 5: Hidden Business Logic ✅ OUT OF SCOPE + NOTES FEATURE ADDED
*Tax optimization and compliance tracking out of scope - bot provides audit trail and export. Added user-editable notes field per trade for personal insights (FR10, Story 3.2, Story 4.3)*

### Tax and Compliance:
**Q5.1:** Tax implications tracking:
- Wash sale rules applicable to systematic trading?
- Short-term vs long-term classification (likely all short-term)
- Cost basis adjustments after SPY strangle rolls
- Section 1256 contracts (SPX) vs regular options (SPY)

**Q5.2:** Broker-specific constraints:
- Pattern Day Trader rules - do they apply?
- Options approval levels required
- Margin call procedures during drawdowns
- Position limits per underlying

### Documentation Requirements:
- Trade justification for systematic strategy
- Audit trail for tax reporting
- Compliance monitoring for regulatory changes

---

## Topic 6: User Experience Blind Spots ✅ COMPLETED
*Vacation Mode rejected (overengineering). Smart Notification Management added with Discord channel separation, market-hours-only alerts, pre-strategy notifications, and digest mode (Story 2.4, Story 3.4)*

### ✅ Smart Notification Management Implemented:
- **3 Discord Channels:** Critical/Warning/Info (user-configurable)
- **Market Hours Only:** No alerts outside trading hours + pre-strategy notifications
- **Digest Mode:** INFO alerts collected and sent daily
- **Timing Control:** 1h before strategy execution (configurable 30-120min)
- **Severity Levels:** INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL with appropriate routing

### Monitoring Complexity:
- Dashboard information overload
- Key metrics vs nice-to-have data
- Mobile interface priority hierarchy
- Offline access to critical information

---

## Topic 7: Performance & Scaling

### Data Management:
**Q7.1:** Storage and retention:
- How much historical data to maintain locally?
- Database growth projections (5+ years of tick data)
- Backup and disaster recovery strategy
- Data export formats for external analysis

**Q7.2:** System scaling considerations:
- Adding 5-10 more strategies in the future
- Multiple TWS accounts/brokers
- Cloud vs local deployment options
- Performance bottlenecks identification

### Technical Debt:
- Code maintainability with multiple strategies
- Configuration management complexity
- Testing strategy for multi-strategy interactions
- Documentation and knowledge transfer

---

## Topic 8: Regulatory & Compliance

### Trading Classification:
**Q8.1:** Regulatory status clarification:
- Retail trader vs professional designation
- Systematic trading reporting requirements
- Any SEC/FINRA notifications needed for algorithmic trading
- GDPR/privacy considerations for trade data

**Q8.2:** Audit and documentation:
- Requirement to prove all trades were systematic (not discretionary)
- Documentation standards for tax authorities
- Record retention requirements
- Third-party system integration compliance

### Risk Management:
- Know Your Customer (KYC) implications
- Anti-money laundering considerations
- Position reporting thresholds
- Cross-border trading implications (US markets from Europe)

3. **Integrate findings** into PRD as additional stories/requirements
4. **Prioritize implementation** based on Phase 1 needs
