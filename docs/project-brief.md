# Option-Strategies Bot-Trader: Project Brief

**Generated by BMAD Analysis Session**  
**Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

### Project Overview
**Project Name:** Option-Strategies Bot-Trader  
**Project Type:** Personal automation system with potential for commercialization  
**Primary Objective:** Having more time and peace of mind when trading favorite, backtested strategies  
**Strategic Context:** This will be the bread and butter trades - targeting 80% of portfolio activity

### Core Problem Statement
Manual options trading requires constant daily attention and is prone to human error, making it incompatible with work schedules, travel, or other commitments. Current manual process results in:

- **2-3% portfolio loss per week** when unable to trade due to scheduling conflicts
- **1-2 hours daily monitoring** requirement, creating stress and time constraints  
- **High error risk** from manual OCA group setup, incorrect stops/limits, sign errors
- **Emotional trading decisions** affecting strategy consistency
- **Complexity barrier** preventing spouse from executing strategies independently

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1 Success:** 30 successful automated SPX Iron Condor trades with full OCA management
- **Phase 2 Success:** 30 successful automated SPY Strangle trades with rolling capability  
- **Ultimate Goal:** Both strategies running reliably, discussing 3rd strategy implementation
- **Business Impact:** Eliminate 2-3% weekly opportunity cost and reduce daily time commitment to monitoring-only

## Solution Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime:** Python 3.11+ (chosen for robust TWS API support)
- **IB Integration:** ib_insync library for TWS communication  
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI for REST API and dashboard backend
- **Frontend:** HTML + HTMX + Chart.js (no build pipeline required)
- **Database:** SQLite for trade history and state management
- **Notifications:** Discord.py for bot implementation
- **Container:** Podman deployment on Mac environment
- **Installation:** Homebrew with private tap distribution

### Core Strategy Implementation
**Phase 1: SPX Iron Condor (0DTE)**
- Daily execution at 9:32 ET (2 minutes after market open)
- Delta 15 targeting (±1.9 tolerance) with 20-point wings
- Atomic combo/BAG order execution via TWS
- Triple OCA exit management: 25% profit target, 11:30 ET close, 300% stop-loss
- Manual override compatibility with logging

**Phase 2: SPY Strangle (42 DTE)**  
- Weekly Friday 18:00 CET (12:00 ET) execution using TastyTrade Expected Move formula
- Strike selection: Put below Expected Move, Call above Expected Move (nearest available strikes)
- Intelligent defensive rolling at ≤28 DTE when strike tested
- Mandatory 21 DTE close regardless of P/L or roll status
- Dual time tracking: contract expiry AND strategy exit times

### Manual Override Compatibility
**Critical Requirement:** System must robustly handle manual TWS interventions:
- Position polling to detect manual changes
- Trading log notation when manual actions detected  
- **NO automatic corrections** - system adapts to user changes
- Prevents duplicate trades or conflicting orders

## User Experience Design

### Design Philosophy
- **UI FIRST approach** - Rapid prototyping and iteration priority
- **User-friendly design** - Simple, clear, intuitive for non-technical users
- **Apple Aqua aesthetic** - Glossy, translucent elements with smooth gradients
- **Mobile-first responsive** - Equally functional on desktop and mobile
- **Status-first display** - Immediate visual recognition of system health

### Core UI Innovation: Integrated Progress Visualization
Each strategy displays an **integrated progress bar** showing current phase:

```
SPX Iron Condor                           [⏸️ STOP]
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✅→⏰→📊→🛒→🟡→⚫  P/L: +$125.50  |  Next: 17:30    │
│ ████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Progress Phases:**
- ✅ TWS Connected → ⏰ Market Open → 📊 Options Found → 🛒 Order Placed → 🟡 Monitoring → ⚫ Closed

### Traffic Light Status System
- **🟢 GREEN:** System healthy, positions profitable, no intervention needed
- **🟡 YELLOW:** Attention required, warnings present, connection issues
- **🔴 RED:** Immediate action needed, critical errors, position losses

### Key User Journeys
**Primary Users:**
1. **Experienced Trader (Primary)** - Full control, detailed monitoring, strategy optimization
2. **Spouse (Secondary)** - Basic monitoring, start/stop capability, emergency controls  
3. **Development Partner (Matthias)** - Testing, feedback, friendly competition motivation

**Critical Actions:**
- Panic/Kill switch with simple confirmation
- Strategy start/stop per strategy or globally
- Mode switching: Experiment ↔ Live with safety confirmations
- Trade annotation and evaluation capabilities
- Status monitoring and notification management

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
**Collaboration Model:**
- **Planning Phase:** Extensive discussion and ASCII prototyping
- **Implementation Phase:** Autonomous development until demo/questions
- **Feedback Loop:** Working prototypes for testing and iteration

### Quality Standards
- **Test-driven development** for critical trading logic
- **Integration testing** with TWS Paper Trading first
- **Manual override testing** to ensure system robustness
- **No shortcuts** - stable, reliable, excellent UX prioritized over speed

### Development Environment
- **Development:** MacBook + Podman + TWS (Paper mode initially)
- **Production:** Mac Mini server deployment
- **Testing:** Both Experiment mode (hypothetical) and TWS Paper Trading

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing:** <€1000 per trade initially
- **Safety Defaults:** All strategies start in Experiment mode
- **Testing Requirement:** Extensive Paper Trading validation before Live mode
- **Manual Override:** System must handle user interventions gracefully

## Resource Allocation

### Timeline Expectations
- **MVP Definition:** IC trade with full OCA setup at 9:32 ET
- **Phase 1:** SPX Iron Condor automation functional ASAP
- **Phase 2:** SPY Strangle addition immediately after Phase 1 success
- **Success Criteria:** 60 total successful trades (30 per strategy)

### Competitive Context
- **Friendly competition** with development partner using Java FX stack
- **Motivation:** Quality and UX excellence over speed
- **Collaboration:** Knowledge sharing and mutual support

### Long-term Vision
**Immediate Goals:**
- Generate consistent trading profits through automation
- Eliminate manual trading stress and time requirements
- Create foundation for additional complex strategies

**Future Expansion:**
- **Complex Strategies:** Diagonal spreads, broken butterflies, custom combinations
- **AI Integration:** Trade analysis, pattern recognition, optimization suggestions
- **Simulation Engine:** Live "what-if" scenario testing and backtesting
- **Example:** "Track First Touch scenarios - would Second Touch with 30 Delta have been statistically better?"

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Primary Technical Risks
1. **TWS API Complexity** - Mitigated by test-driven development and extensive integration testing

- **Fixed Contract Mode:** User-configurable contract counts per strategy (default: 1)
- **Percentage Mode:** Dynamic sizing based on % of NLV or available margin
- **Real-time Validation:** Check margin requirements and display warnings
- **User Control:** All sizing decisions remain with trader, system validates feasibility

### System Safeguards
- **Kill Switch:** Accessible via Discord and web interface with confirmation
- **State Recovery:** Persistent state management prevents duplicate trades after crashes
- **Manual Override:** System gracefully handles user interventions without conflicts

### Success Dependencies
